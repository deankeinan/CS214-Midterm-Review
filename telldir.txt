NAME
       telldir - return current location in directory stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       long telldir(DIR *dirp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       telldir(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The telldir() function returns the current location associated with the
       directory stream dirp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the telldir() function returns the current location in  the
       directory stream.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropri-
       ately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid directory stream descriptor dirp.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the return type of telldir()  was	off_t.
       POSIX.1-2001  specifies	long,  and  this  is the type used since glibc
       2.1.2.
