NAME
       ipcrm - remove a message queue, semaphore set or shared memory id

SYNOPSIS
       ipcrm [ -M key | -m id | -Q key | -q id | -S key | -s id ] ...

       deprecated usage

       ipcrm {shm|msg|sem} id...

DESCRIPTION
       ipcrm  removes  System  V  interprocess communication (IPC) objects and
       associated data structures from the system.  In order  to  delete  such
       objects,	 you must be superuser, or the creator or owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message queues,
       and  semaphores.	  Deletion  of	a message queue or semaphore object is
       immediate (regardless of whether any process still holds an IPC identi-
       fier for the object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all
       currently attached processes have detached (shmdt(2)) the  object  from
       their virtual address space.

       Two syntax styles are supported.	 The old Linux historical syntax spec-
       ifies a three letter keyword indicating which class of object is to  be
       deleted,	 followed  by  one or more IPC identifiers for objects of this
       type.

       The SUS-compliant syntax allows	the  specification  of	zero  or  more
       objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects spec-
       ified either by key or by identifier. (See below.)  Both keys and iden-
       tifiers	may  be	 specified  in decimal, hexadecimal (specified with an
       initial ’0x’ or ’0X’), or octal (specified with an initial ’0’).


OPTIONS
       -M shmkey
	      removes the shared memory segment created with shmkey after  the
	      last detach is performed.

       -m shmid
	      removes  the shared memory segment identified by shmid after the
	      last detach is performed.

       -Q msgkey
	      removes the message queue created with msgkey.

       -q msgid
	      removes the message queue identified by msgid.

       -S semkey
	      removes the semaphore created with semkey.

       -s semid
	      removes the semaphore identified by semid.

       The details of the removes are described in msgctl(2),  shmctl(2),  and
       semctl(2).  The identifiers and keys may be found by using ipcs(1).

NOTES
       In  its	first  Linux  implementation, ipcrm used the deprecated syntax
       shown in the SYNOPSIS.  Functionality present in other *nix implementa-
       tions  of  ipcrm	 has  since  been  added, namely the ability to delete
       resources by key (not just identifier), and to respect  the  same  com-
       mand-line  syntax.  For	backward  compatibility the previous syntax is
       still supported.

AVAILABILITY
       The ipcrm command is part of the util-linux-ng package and is available
       from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.
